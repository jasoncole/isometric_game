there's like 100+ spells in the game

TRAITS, SKILLS, SPELLS, HEROIC ABILITIES, and TITLES:
traits are specific to the individual or their race. traits can be developed but only by significant milestones in character development
skills are gained by training them. Has levels.
spells need to be learned (from spell scrolls or grimoires) and you can only have as many as your magic level allows. Each spell has a type that determines how it fuses with other spells. You can level up spells with skill points.
heroic abilities are special powers granted to the hero, they are not limited like normal spells. Heroic abilities are kept across all saves
titles are bestowed, or gained by completing feats. some titles can be removed if their conditions are no longer met

ABILITY DESIGN RULES:
1. Does one, specific thing; can be explained conceptually in one sentence
2. simple execution; No more than 1 button, 1 press execution
3. must be understandable independently, not dependent on other abilities

FUSION

get new spells by combining spells with each other like persona or shin megami tensei
fusing specific spells can increase their power (?)

problem: how does fusion work?
needs to be predictable/systematic
spells are divided into types based on the mechanics of the spell
combing spells of specific types will create a spell of another type with a higher rarity

spell types:
- emission
- aura
- transmutation
- curse
- blessing
- conjuring
- spirit
- holy
- witchcraft
- arcane

Example Spells:
spell copy (transmutation) (arcane)
disguise (transmutation)
stealth (transmutation) or (blessing)
stasis (curse)
za warudo (holy)
blink (emission)
teleport (emission)
clairvoyance (emission)
werewolf transformation (transmutation) (witchcraft)
summon wolves (conjuring)
tornado (spirit)
monsoon (spirit)
degen aura (aura) (curse)

EVOLUTION

specific skills will automatically combine and evolve to make more powerful skills once they are maxed
traits can evolve at specific race or character development milestones
some titles are used as prerequisites for larger titles

WEAPONS
each character can only use a specific weapon
a character can only change weapons as dictated by scripted character sequences
reasons:
1. hard to make animations for each character and weapon type
2. I don't want the player to be limited to a small portion of the available weapons
3. it's confusing to have 2 classes of items: inventory items and wearable items

unfortunately no weapon skills :(


I would prefer if this game shipped on console but I will design with PC first in mind

CONTROLS

with controller,
can issue simple commands to summoned units:
follow - follow hero and copy their actions
farm - target nearest creep
fight - target nearest hero
push - target nearest lane

creeps use abilties automatically
