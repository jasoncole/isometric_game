stats
every stat should be useful for every hero
no primary attributes
each stat offers offensive and defensive potential
strength gives damage, hp, and hp regen
agility gives attack speed, movement speed, and evasion (evasion from agility is multiplicative with each other)
intelligence gives mana and mana regen

there are also heroic abilities that scale based on intelligence
heroic abilities are equippable in base and you can swap them whenever you want

heroic abilities:
mana shield - reduce a percentage of incoming damage
mana burst - gain brief invulnerability and slow enemies
flash - propel a short distance in target direction
armament mana - deal bonus on-hit magic damage
aeon disk - block lethal damage then heal a small amount
second wind - soft dispel and briefly increase movespeed
restore - heal

crafting:
can collect materials from neutrals to use for crafting
materials can be exchanged with other players
materials can be used to craft powerful consumables or to upgrade normal items
mid-game items like mek or desolator can be upgraded through crafting
lategame items like manta style or butterfly have crafting upgrades that drastically change how the item works
these can be sidegrades that make the item worse in some aspects but better in others

barriers block all damage types and are not affected by reductions like armor or magic resistance
barrier takes damage before health
barrier automatically ticks down by a percentage of current barrier amount
barrier is a hero stat and is not tied to any modifier
for skills that previously used barrier like flame guard and aphotic shield, they are tied to a modifier that reduces damage until pre-reduction threshold is reached. multiple of these skills will all expire together


lifesteal works as a percentage of damage dealt to health
lifesteal is reduced by armor and negated by physical barrier
lifesteal is not a strictly attack-based mechanic
anything that does damage can lifesteal (but no lifesteal items)


no phyics. only one forced movement can act on a player at once (like dota)

buffs and debuffs can be weak, strong, or universal
dispels on enemies remove all buffs with less than or equal strength to the dispel
dispels on allies remove all debuffs with less than or equal strength to the dispel
there is no such thing as a universal dispel or anything that removes universal modifiers
BKB provides immunity to strong debuffs and magic resistance (still allows for casting of spells and application of debuff)
maybe have a lesser BKB that provides immunity to weak debuffs

fountain does not have a highground
heroes are briefly immune after respawning, until they leave the fountain

status resistance can exist, but it should not persist on debuffs that last longer than the status resistance buff
also, things like poison deal the exact same damage every second, even when their duration is reduced
status resistance does not change how much damage is dealt, or how often it is dealt
it does change the total damage dealt
there's no passive status resistance like sange or satanic. only from abilities like ursa's enrage
alternatively: DoT works like negative hp regen
does not deal damage at discrete intervals - so status resistance does not have lucky or unlucky breakpoitns

no passive gold.
you can buy items on credit, putting you at a negative gold total
buying more than you have costs interest (interest is based on the item's original cost)
you have to pay off interest before buying more items
the amount you can spend on credit is based on a percentage of your net worth

you don't lose gold on death

each buyback makes each subsequent buyback increase by a scaling factor
getting a killstreak reduces the scaling factor
10x killstreak reduces the scaling factor to 1x
buyback cooldown is 2 minutes + respawn time

NO DoT in the game ticks down faster than once a second (because of refraction-type abilities)
Cleave is no longer directional. It is a splash attack like league or like tiny tree grab
Pseudo random distribution has an increased floor and a lower ceiling
abilities like clinkz barrage or drow arrow only create one attack record so they cannot proc things like maelstrom multiple times
Maelstrom does not have an internal cooldown

Couriers are per hero
Couriers do not have respawn timers
If your courier dies, you have to walk back to base to revive it
Couriers do not have vision, but allied dropped items are visible at all times
You cannot normally interact with items from other players

No cast while channeling

should linkens be in the game?

lifesteal works after reductions so it's countered by armor
blademail does not return a percentage of damage taken
blademail triggers on attack and returns a flat number (built out of vanguard?)

there is no max level
levelling up just requires exponentially more exp
once you have maxed out your abilities, you can level your skill tree
skill tree offers powerful upgrades to abilities and can even create interactions between abilities
after maxxing your skill tree, you can get generic stat bonuses
skill tree upgrades should do roughly what the ability was already trying to do
they should not fundamentally alter the way the ability works
most are (substantial) number increases
some skill tree nodes require multiple levels to be spent at once

heroes have 0 base magic resist
creeps have negative base magic resist
makes kill calculations slightly easier

modifiers do not automatically transfer to illusions
crit is not copied
auras like radiance are not copied
passives that are specified to affect illusions automatically add the modifier to the illusion when the illusion is created
modifiers that grant attributes do not need to be applied to illusions because attributes are copied automatically

when using teleportation abilities, go to point closest to teleport location along a straight line. You can't teleport inside terrain then be pushed past teleport location.

there's like 100+ spells in the game

TRAITS, SKILLS, SPELLS, HEROIC ABILITIES, and TITLES:
traits are specific to the individual or their race. traits can be developed but only by significant milestones in character development
skills are gained by training them. Has levels.
spells need to be learned (from spell scrolls or grimoires) and you can only have as many as your magic level allows. Each spell has a type that determines how it fuses with other spells. You can level up spells with skill points.
heroic abilities are special powers granted to the hero, they are not limited like normal spells. Heroic abilities are kept across all saves
titles are bestowed, or gained by completing feats. some titles can be removed if their conditions are no longer met

UI:
organized into passive and active abilities
you can open a menu to choose which active abilities are available on the hot bar

Example Traits:
dragonskin
fast reflexes
super strength
protector
exceptional talent

Example Skills:
appraisal
dimensional storage
gardening
growth
thought acceleration
mind's eye / imagination
mana sensitivity


Heroic Abilities:
load/save
pause/rewind/fastforward

Example Titles:
dragonslayer
bane of dragons
world's strongest swordsman
world's strongest mage
hero
demon Lord
saintess
thief
murderer

ABILITY DESIGN RULES:
1. Does one, specific thing; can be explained conceptually in one sentence
2. simple execution; No more than 1 button, 1 press execution
3. must be understandable independently, not dependent on other abilities

FUSION

get new spells by combining spells with each other like persona or shin megami tensei
fusing specific spells can increase their power (?)

problem: how does fusion work?
needs to be predictable/systematic
spells are divided into types based on the mechanics of the spell
combing spells of specific types will create a spell of another type with a higher rarity

spell types:
- emission
- aura
- transmutation
- curse
- blessing
- conjuring
- spirit
- holy
- witchcraft
- arcane

Example Spells:
spell copy (transmutation) (arcane)
disguise (transmutation)
stealth (transmutation) or (blessing)
stasis (curse)
za warudo (holy)
blink (emission)
teleport (emission)
clairvoyance (emission)
werewolf transformation (transmutation) (witchcraft)
summon wolves (conjuring)
tornado (spirit)
monsoon (spirit)
degen aura (aura) (curse)

EVOLUTION

specific skills will automatically combine and evolve to make more powerful skills once they are maxed
traits can evolve at specific race or character development milestones
some titles are used as prerequisites for larger titles

WEAPONS
each character can only use a specific weapon
a character can only change weapons as dictated by scripted character sequences
reasons:
1. hard to make animations for each character and weapon type
2. I don't want the player to be limited to a small portion of the available weapons
3. it's confusing to have 2 classes of items: inventory items and wearable items

unfortunately no weapon skills :(


I would prefer if this game shipped on console but I will design with PC first in mind

CONTROLS

with controller,
can issue simple commands to summoned units:
follow - follow hero and copy their actions
farm - target nearest creep
fight - target nearest hero
push - target nearest lane

creeps use abilties automatically
